# OcelotFix

Ocelots can be tamed into cats, like pre-1.14. The cat variant that spawns uses the same logic as vanilla cat spawning (ie, Black Cats can only spawn during moons)

**Note**: It is still possible to breed ocelots with this mod, to make sure the Two by Two advancement is completable.
If you are trying to *tame* an ocelot and turn it into a cat, you need to make sure to fulfill the same conditions as making an ocelot trust you in vanilla. This might take a few tries, as the odds of doing so are unchanged.
